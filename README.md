# B2B-SaaS-Platoform
This project is a production-ready, scalable backend architecture for a multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform, built using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Docker. It features tenant data isolation, user role management, external API integrations, and asynchronous webhook processing â€” all designed with extensibility and cloud readiness in mind.
